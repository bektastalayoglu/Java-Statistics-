# Java-Statistics-
Write a program that uses a set of ï¬‚oating-point values (double[] is fine here). These values need to be associated with the instance of a class.

Calculate the following properties:

The average of the set: getAverage()
The minimum and maximum value: getSmallest() and getLargest().
The range of the set (difference between the largest and smallest): getRange()
The following conditions need to be meet:

- Your class is called DataSet
- The class contains a method add(double value) that will add a value to the existing set.
- Avoid code duplication!
- There is no need to implement a main() method.
